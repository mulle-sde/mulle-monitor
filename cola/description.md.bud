**mulle-monitor** watches for the creation, deletion and updates of files
in the working directory (and its sub-directories) using
[fswatch](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch) or
[inotifywait](https://linux.die.net/man/1/inotifywait). It then
matches those filenames against a set of *patternfiles* to determine the
appropriate executable to call.

> In mulle-sde mulle-monitor is mainly just used for starting tasks. The
> actual monitoring is rarely used.
